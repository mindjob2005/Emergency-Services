Lore Vehicles -
In the Lore Folder, it will contain base GTA V cars
that have been converted over to Emergency Services Vehicles.
These vehicles are non-ELS cars.

You have to download the whole pack, the reason being is that the Sirens are all controlled by the Granger carcol.meta file (This might change in the future for 
each car to have the sirens pattern in their carcols.meta file).

They include Red-Blue Lights, Blue-Blue Lights (WIP), and Red-White Lights.
All vehicles, except for Sultan, Patriot, and the Torrence have callsigns and door decals. I will try to get the the remaining cars callsigns and door decals done.
Department of Corrections Vehicles (Mainly all SUV's) have a Corrections Door Decal. All Door decals are under the "Roof" in the modkits, the reason being is because
some mechanic scripts for QBCore Servers, do not allow modifications for the doors. The Wide Body Buffalo's door decals are under the "Dials" Modification!

This pack is still a work in progress and will be updated as I make changes to the vehicles!

Vehicles included are:
Wide Body Buffalo - Buffalo Hellfire
Buffalo
Buffalo S
Fugitive
Scout
Caracara
2022 Caracara
Hellhound Gresley
Dominator GTX
Vigero
Coquette D10
Gauntlet Hellfire
Bison
Torrence
Stanier
Baller - WIP (Needs Door Decals Done)
Tailgater WIP (Needs Door Decals Done)
Kuruma
Sultan - WIP (Not Started)
Granger
Patriot - WIP (Needs Callsigns/Door Decals)
Jackel - WIP (Not Started)

Under each vehicle is a "mods" folder, inside that folder may have sub folders for Callsigns and Door Decals. I am a little OCD in file management and this makes it easier for me when I need to adjust something.

The light textures are broken up into 2 ytd's to limit the size of the vehicles ytd's
Each folder will be labeled for the color of lights and will include templates for making liveries.

Thank you for looking at the work that I have done, I will be adding in pre-made liveries for lore cars as I continue to make some.
